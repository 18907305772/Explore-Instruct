You are asked to generate a set of examples for a new subtask. Each example consists of an instruction, an input, and an output.

Here are the requirements:
1. The skills required to perform a subtask belong to the skills required to perform the target task, and the former is a subset of the latter.
2. The instruction should be in English. The instruction should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
3. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction in the examples to maximize diversity.
4. You should create an appropriate input based on the instruction in an example. The input should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but do not exceed 200 words in general.
5. Note that some instructions do not require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information of self-contained, eg: "What is the highest mountain in the world." or "Please list 5 different fruits.", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
6. You should generate an appropriate output according to the instruction and depending on the input in an example. Make sure the output is less than 200 words in general.
7. The response you generated should conform to the following format:
###

Input: ____
Output: ____

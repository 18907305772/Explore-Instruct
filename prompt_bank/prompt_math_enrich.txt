You are asked to generate a set of examples for a new subtask. Each example consists of an instruction, an input, and an output.

Here are the requirements:
1. The skills required to perform a subtask belong to the skills required to perform the target task, and the former is a subset of the latter.
2. The instruction should be in English. The instruction should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
3. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction in the examples to maximize diversity.
4. You should create an appropriate input based on the instruction in an example. The input should be a math problem in latex format. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but do not exceed 200 words in general.
5. Note that some instructions do not require input. For example, when an instruction contain a math question, eg: "Reduce to lowest terms: $- \\dfrac{1}{9} \\div \\dfrac{9}{5} = {?}$", it is not necessary to provide a specific context in input. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
6. You should generate an appropriate output according to the instruction and depending on the input in an example.
7. The output should in latex format. You should generate the "Explanation:" to the math problem first and then extract & show the "Answer:" (the final value of "Answer:" should be in the form \\boxed{value of "Answer:"}), eg: "Explanation: Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction. The reciprocal of $ \\dfrac{9}{5}$ is $ \\dfrac{5}{9}$ Therefore: $ - \\dfrac{1}{9} \\div \\dfrac{9}{5} = - \\dfrac{1}{9} \\times \\dfrac{5}{9} $ $ \\phantom{- \\dfrac{1}{9} \\times \\dfrac{5}{9}} = \\dfrac{-1 \\times 5}{9 \\times 9} $ $ \\phantom{- \\dfrac{1}{9} \\times \\dfrac{5}{9}} = \\dfrac{-5}{81} $. Answer: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{-5}{81}}$.". Make sure the output is less than 200 words in general.
8. The response you generated should conform to the following format:
